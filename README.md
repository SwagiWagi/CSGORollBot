# CSGOrollBot
A simple, bad written, not maintained, worthless, piece of sh*t bot for the crash game at csgoroll.com.

Maven project, using Selenium.

Run the program with the following arguments:

0. chromeDriver path.
1. Round entry amount.
2. Exit multiplier.
3. Rounds limit.

Once you run the program, you will have to manually log in to the site, because, well, they don't have any API as you've already noticed :/

If you're actually going to use it, you have a snapshot at /target/.
